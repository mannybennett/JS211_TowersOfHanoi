CODE PLAN

Terminal:
1) Understand what the {stacks} object is and how to access it's contents.
2) For the movePiece() function, determine what methods need to be used in order to move a "piece" from one array to another.
3) For the isLegal() function, determine what condition needs to be met in order for it to be true; as well as what methods or syntax to use within the -if- statement.
4) For the checkForWin() function, determine what condition needs to be met for a win. What am I checking for in the -if- statement? Am I covering all possibilities?
5) For the towersOfHanoi() function, determine in what order the previous functions need to be called. How should the given parameters be connected to the other functions? Should I have a message display if the move is not legal?
6) Assure that I am returning the correct values within each function.
7) DRY my code, keep everything clear.

GUI:
1) Utilize my previous code.
2) Create three <div>'s within my html file that will be the stacks/placeholders for the blocks.
3) Create four additional <div>'s that will serve as the blocks themselves.
